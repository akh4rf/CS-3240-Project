## Hoos Active

This is our project for CS 3240 - Hoos Active

Checkout our website [here](https://hoos-active.herokuapp.com)

Our website aims to encourage users to exercise and self-report exercise through features that promote friendly competition with other users. 
Upon logging in, users can access all of HoosActive's features. On the home screen, users can add an exercise to their profile after selecting the exercise type, duration, timestamp, and the calories burned.
This exercise is self-reported and will be added to a leaderboard for other users to see. 
Users can also schedule different types of workouts for themselves on the homepage. 

On the profile page, users can input and display their stats such as picture, age, height, and weight. The profile page also displays a graph showing users their calories burned per day during a weeks span. 
Users can also use this page to view their friends list and be able to search for and add other users as friends. Having a friends list will further emphasize a sense of community on the website so that users can compete and encourage each other. 

On the leaderboard page, users view a leaderboard that displays top users names, location, calories burned, and duration for the particular exercise that users can select to view. This leaderboard can be sorted by a bunch of different options such as by calories burned, total hours, or by the timeframe. Users can also choose to filter the leaderboard to view either view all users or users from their friend list.
